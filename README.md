# Minigames

This is a collection of minigames that I have created. Each minigame is a separate project, and each project is a separate folder in this repository. Each minigame is written in Python.

## Minigames

- [Gamble](./Gamble7/Gamble7.py): A simple gambling game.
- [Snake Game](./Snake_Game/SnakeGame.py): A simple snake game.
- [Space Invaders](./Space_Invaders/SpaceInvader.py): A simple space invaders game.

## Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your computer to run these games. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Setup

You can clone this repository by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thej-Venkat-P/Minigames
```
Change the curr_path variable in SpaceInvader.py to the path of the Space_Invaders folder in your computer.

```python
curr_path = r"path to the Space_Invaders folder on your device"
```

## How to run

You can the play the games individually by running the main file in each project.  

You can also maintain scores with other players by playing through the [Main Gui](MainGUI.py) file.
